    "\n",
    "Simulators are useful tools that enable a reduction in development costs for robotic controllers. A variety of open-source simulation packages are readily available and can be used to develop high fidelity models with accompanying 3D graphics. When developed correctly, these simulators can stand in as a substitute for real hardware. This allows the controls developer to employ a lower cost, software focused, and test-driven approach towards developing their control logic. This saves them from the risk of damaging expensive hardware and also reduces the cost and development time. This paper details a case study in which this approach is employed to develop a low cost real-time controller for an unstable robotic system. Bobble-Bot is a custom built, two wheeled, self-balancing robot. It employs an embedded Real-Time Linux OS running a high bandwidth control loop. This paper starts with a derivation of the underlying equations of motion for the system. Next, a survey of available simulation tools is provided including: Python with NumPy/SciPy, Matlab Simulink, ROS with Gazebo, and the Unreal Engine. Simulations of increasing fidelity are then developed and used in order to test Bobble-Bot's controller. Finally, the source code and samples of simulation results are provided.\n"

    "Bobble-Bot is a modern take on a classical problem in control theory. The robot represents\n",

    "control system include: robots in domestic and industrial use, control of rockets and missiles,\n",
    "and object transport utilizing drones [1]. Though the theory is well understood, an imple-\n",

    "The major hardware components used by Bobble-Bot are shown in the image below. The Raspberry\n",
    "Pi (RPi) was selected primarily because it was a cheap open-hardware Linux computer that could easily run the Robot Operating System. Brushless DC motors were used because of their advantages in precision speed control, low power consumption, and durability. CAN hardware was selected in order to facilitate sending command and status packets to and from the motor controllers at a high rate (1 Mbps). A LiPo battery and PDU was selected and supplies enough power to enable three hours of continuous operation. The BNO055 IMU [2] was selected as an affordable and complete orientation sensor solution. The sensors is capable of providing a sufficiently accurate tilt and heading angle. This particular IMU requires only a minimal level of driver software development in order to integrate into the selected control system software architecture. The AS5047D [3] absolute position sensor was selected in order to provide an accurate motor position and velocity reading.\n",

    "## Software Modules\n",
    "The task of balancing Bobble-Bot is achieved by a control algorithm that implements a linear control law. This control law describes a mathematical equation that relates system errors to motor torque commands. The equation can be implemented within a single function provided the error values can be represented faithfully, and the motor torque commands can be executed reliably. The whole system must run in a loop so that the control law can be executed and rapidly update the commands to the motor before the robot tips over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical software tasks can be divided up into modules that are responsible for the following tasks: control law implementation, robot state management, orientation sensing, command packaging, receiving motor status data, encoding communication frames, decoding communication frames, packet transmission, receiving CAN frames, and command handling and data routing. There are many other smaller modules that are also needed for signal processing, data exchange, logging, error handling, and miscellaneous math libraries to list just a few. It is also important to realize that the Bobble-Bot control software is written on-top of a large set of open-source modules available within the Linux and ROS software stack. It is a fairly large set of software modules that must be organized and managed.\n",

    "The video below comes from an early hardware based test of Bobble-Bot's controller logic. At the time this video was taken, the focus of Bobble-Bot development had been on assemblying the hardware and wiring together all of the components. The controller logic was prototyped and demonstrated on the new hardware, and this video was recorded. The video shows the difficulty in proceeding with controller software development using a solely hardware based testing approach."

    "## Why Simulate?\n",
    "The control jitter seen in the video above needs to be eliminated and the controller software needs futher tuning. We would like to do this in a way that doesn't risk accidentally toppling Bobble-Bot over and damaging the hardware or wiring. Damage of that sort would cause significant delay in the development schedule. One way to solve the problem is to develop a simulation so that controller testing can be done using a purely software based approach. Of course, this immediately eliminates the risk of damaging hardware. Additionally, it allows separate developers to simultaneously implement and test their control algorithms using their own instance of the Bobble-Bot simulator. These are two big advantages that ultimately reduce the development cost and schedule. So how do we develop a simulation of Bobble-Bot? As with many tasks in engineering, it is helpful to first gain an understanding of the system dynamics using a mathematical model."

    "# Derivation of Math Model\n",
    "This section derives the Bobble-Bot state space representation by linearizing the equations of motion about a balance point. This is done not only as an excercise in understanding the unstable and non-linear dynamics of the Bobble-Bot system, but also to serve as a basis for implementing prototype simulations in an effort to select viable control system gains using modern control theory. The derivation can be conveniently split into two parts by the introduction of internal forces. Px and Py capture the forces imparted on the pendulum body at the pendulum/wheel joint. As will be seen as the derivation progresses, these forces are solved for and used to combine the equations derived from the two separate pendulum and wheel free-body diagrams. We end up with equations of motion that are in terms of the torque applied by the motors, pendulum length, mass, inertia, and wheel diameter. "

    "\n",
    "Gazebo was selected as the framework of choice for the high fidelity, hardware in the loop, Bobble-Bot simulator. Gazebo is free, open-source, and provides direct support for ROS control. ROS control is the controller architecture that was adopted for Bobble-Bot. One of the key advantages of this architecture is that it provides carefully designed software abstraction layers that enable running real-time controllers with either simulation or hardware in the loop. The controller is agnostic about whether it is running with a simulator in the loop or the real system. This approach allows developers to iron out any lingering bugs and tune their control algorithms using simulation. This is a less risky proposition than developing directly on real hardware with the risk of imposing damage to people or property. This architecture is depicted in the diagram below [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/Gazebo_ros_transmission.png\" alt=\"Sim Architecture\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator includes a model of the mass properties (center of gravity and inertia matrix), the wheel friction, motor joints, gravity, and tilt sensor. When the simulator runs without the controller in the loop, the Bobble-Bot model immediately topples over. This is just like in real life. Bobble-Bot requires active control. It is only when the balance controller is ran alongside the simulator, can simulated Bobble-Bot maintain its balance. One of the nice advantages of the simulator is that it can be used to tune the Bobble-Bot PID control gains without the risk of damaging hardware. To do this we were able to run many separate impulse force tests within the simulated environment. These tests involve applying a force of 200-500 Newtons over a tenth of a second time step. This results in an impulse force of 4.5-11.25 lbf*s. This gives the simulated Bobble-Bot a jolt not unlike the one shown in the real hardware testing videos. After that we record the controlled response, manually adjust our control gains, and repeat the process until we get the desired response. Some plots from these simulated runs for different controller gains are shown below.\n",

    "## Automated Simulation Runs\n",
    "The above data and plots are generated with a set of automated Python based unit-test scripts. These scripts repeatedly initialize and reset the simulated Bobble-Bot dynamic state, apply an impulse force, allow for and record the controlled response for ten seconds, and then repeat the process with a new impulse force. Once all the data is captured, open-source Python analysis tools [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) are used to generate the curves shown in the previous section. This is a useful approach that enables using the simulation to perform any number of automated, closed-loop, tests of the balance control logic. The video below shows an example of this in action. It is important to note that the simulator can also be run in a headless state (no 3D graphics). This cuts down on the length of time needed to perform each automated test run.\n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "The preceding sections of this report cover the use of simulation for the development and test of control algorithms for a two wheeled self-balancing robot. We started with an overview of the real system hardware and its performance. Motivated by a desire to improve controller performance, minimize risk, and reduce cost to ongoing controller development, we decided to create a high fidelity simulator. To start, we derived a mathematical model of our system and arrived at a state space formulation. From there, we surveyed a variety of the commonly selected simulation tools and assesed their strengths and weaknesses. After the pros and cons were considered, the Gazebo simulation environment was selected. Using Gazebo, a simulation of the robot was developed and then used to tune our balance control algorithm. A sampling of results were then recorded and presented. Follow on work will include testing the tuned balance control algorithm with the Bobble-Bot hardware and assessing the performance improvements. Data recorded from these hardware based tests will then feed back into the simulation development and tuning. A few testing iterations will be done until we are confident that the simulated robot and real robot have similar response characteristics. These testing iterations will help to ensure that a robust set of control logic is arrived at. The hope is that Bobble-Bot will then be able to execute user supplied 2D position and velocity profiles. Given our time and budget constraints, it is hard to imagine how this end result would be possible without these simulators."
